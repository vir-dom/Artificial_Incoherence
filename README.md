# Artificial_Incoherence
Deep Learning Homework

## Team name: Artificial Incoherence
## Team members:
 - Bálint Gergő (O78UXU)
 - Medgyes Csaba (RF8I8P)
 - Virsinger Dominika (RSABSD)
 
 ## Project:
  The aim of the project is to predict the age, gender and race of people on pictures.
  Our dataset is the UTKface dataset (available on Kaggle, link can be found in the notebook).
  We are going to try to use some CNN-s, and we also plan to try transfer learning.
  
  Optionail aims:
  When we have a modell with good enough performance, we are going to try implementing it to a mobile app.
  If we have enough time and energy left, we might try the GAN model as well.
  
  So our main goal is to make a very good model and optionally visualize the prediction process in a mobile app.
  
 ## Files:
  You can find an ipynb, which contains the code.
  
  (Note: in the code, we used Google Drive as storage for our files. There are many steps where we saved some variables (X_train, X_test, ...)
   into a file on Drive, so that we do not have to run the code from the beginning every time. These files are too big to upload here, but we can share those on Drive      with you if it is needed. Also, the UTKface dataset was uploaded to Drive, and we loaded the data from there.)
